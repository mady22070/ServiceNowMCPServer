# MCP Server for ServiceNow

The MCP Server for ServiceNow is a generic, modular, and extensible solution designed to enable integration with ServiceNow via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It exposes a range of tools as APIs that can be used for diverse use cases, including ITSM, ITOM, SAM, HAM, CMDB (with enhanced features), PPM, Employee Experience, Reporting, Analytics, dynamic tool registration, and workflow orchestration.

This server is ideal for integrating ServiceNow with AI agents (such as those orchestrated via n8n) or other external systems to automate processes (e.g., automated access provisioning, incident management, asset lifecycle management, and more).

---

## Features

- **Generic ServiceNow Client:**  
  - Supports CRUD operations, query-based record retrieval, and uses both Basic Authentication & OAuth.
  
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Separate modules for ITSM, ITOM, SAM, HAM, CMDB (enhanced), PPM, Employee Experience, Reporting, Analytics, Dynamic Tools, and Workflow.
  
- **Enhanced CMDB:**  
  - Data validation, deduplication, relationship management, enrichment, and audit logging to ensure data integrity and support impact analysis.
  
- **Dynamic Tool Registration:**  
  - Register, deregister, and list dynamic tools at runtime.
  
- **Workflow Orchestration:**  
  - A dedicated workflow module to orchestrate multi-step processes (such as access provisioning), enabling intelligent decision-making and inter-agent communication.
  
- **Rich Prompt Templates:**  
  - Support for dynamic interactions using configurable prompt templates that can be enhanced with AI.
  
- **Optional Self-Service Dashboard:**  
  - Built with FastAPI to enable visualization of reports and real-time monitoring.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- Required libraries (install via pip):
  - `requests`
  - `fastapi` (for the optional dashboard)
  - `uvicorn` (for running the FastAPI server)
  - MCP SDK dependencies (if not already bundled)
  
### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-servicenow.git
   cd mcp-servicenow
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary packages, e.g., requests, fastapi, uvicorn.)*

4. **Configure the Server:**
   
   - Open `config.py` and update:
     - `SN_INSTANCE_URL` with your ServiceNow instance URL.
     - Authentication details: set `SN_AUTH_METHOD` to either `"basic"` or `"oauth"` and provide the corresponding credentials.

5. **Run the MCP Server:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will start the MCP server using the standard I/O transport (ideal for development/testing).

6. **(Optional) Run the Self-Service Dashboard:**

   ```bash
   python portal.py
   ```
   Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8000` to view incident and change reports.

## Usage

### Interacting with the MCP Server

The MCP server exposes various tools that can be invoked by AI agents or workflow orchestration tools. Below are some example tool names and their purpose:

- **ITSM Tools:**
  - `itsm_create_incident` – Create a new incident.
  - `itsm_read_incident` – Retrieve an incident by its sys_id.
  - `itsm_update_incident` – Update incident details.
  - `itsm_delete_incident` – Delete an incident.

- **CMDB Tools (Enhanced):**
  - `cmdb_create_ci` – Create a configuration item (CI) after validation.
  - `cmdb_read_ci` – Read a CI record.
  - `cmdb_update_ci` – Update CI data.
  - `cmdb_delete_ci` – Delete a CI record.
  - `cmdb_query_ci` – Perform advanced queries on CI records.
  - `cmdb_deduplicate` – Identify potential duplicate CIs.
  - `cmdb_add_relationship` – Add a relationship between two CIs.
  - `cmdb_get_relationships` – Get relationships for a specific CI.
  - `cmdb_enrich_ci` – Enrich CI records with additional external data.

- **Workflow Tools:**
  - `workflow_process_access` – Orchestrate the multi-step access provisioning process (includes steps like fetching RITM details, role classification, and assignment).

- **Dynamic Tool Registration:**
  - `register_tool` – Register a new tool dynamically.
  - `deregister_tool` – Remove a tool.
  - `list_registered_tools` – List all dynamically registered tools.

- **Reporting and Analytics:**
  - `report_generate_incident` – Generate an incident report.
  - `report_generate_change` – Generate a change report.
  - `analytics_predict_trends` – Predict incident trends.
  - `analytics_anomaly_detection` – Detect anomalies in incident data.

- **Employee Experience:**
  - `ee_get_feedback` – Retrieve employee feedback records.
  - `ee_create_feedback` – Create a new feedback record.

### How to Invoke a Tool

Tools can be invoked using an MCP client (or via an orchestrator such as n8n). A typical call to a tool sends a message containing:
- The `name` of the tool.
- An `arguments` payload as a JSON object matching the tool’s input schema.

For example, to create an incident via the `itsm_create_incident` tool:

```json
{
  "name": "itsm_create_incident",
  "arguments": {
    "short_description": "Unable to connect to VPN",
    "caller_id": "user123",
    "priority": "High"
  }
}
```

The server will respond with a result containing the ServiceNow API response.
